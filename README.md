# ERIKA_4.0

personal Agriculture assistant or possible survival tool for the lone wanderer.

I tried diluting the code somewhat to make it easier for ANY user to refine it for their specific purposes.

uses:
Raspberry Pi4
Grovepi+
Sun Sensor
Grove Light Sensor
Grove Barometer Bme280
Grove Temp/Humid Sensor(the blue one)
Grove Touch Sensor
Grove Soil Moisture Sensor
Grove RGB-LCD Backlight

i'm no Geologist or Meteorologist so some readings will definately need a tweak or two. expect updates as my understanding improves.
And by all means, let me know how YOURS is coming out!

Cheers!
